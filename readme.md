For boot.dev.

Warning: this code is pretty terrible. I just kind of hacked it together then left it to die.

## Setting Up
1. Clone and `cd` into the repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running (Linux/WSL)
1. Run `source venv/bin/activate` (be sure to run `deactivate` when you're done running the maze solver)
2. Run `./main.sh`
